# sudoku-solver
Sudoku solver app built using express nodejs, with client-server architecture,
the solver algorithm is done on server-side via a POST request from the client app.

This app is made using express and attempted to apply MVC pattern (no database yet though) and client-server architecture.

I do this project as a practice (primarily on deploying a client-server webapp, and secondarily on refactoring old practice algorithm into an API that can be called from client-side web app) so don't mind the 'overkill' tech stacks used in making this.
